# FitbitLifx
A Fitbit app for controlling LIFX light bulbs

You will need a LIFX API key for your LIFX cloud account. 
- Go to https://cloud.lifx.com/settings and sign in. 
- Click "Generate New Token"
- Give it a name E.g. "My Fitbit"
- Copy the token and paste it into the Fitbit LIFX app settings page. If you can't paste it in immediately, make a note of the token so that you can use it later as it won't be displayed again, although you can always generate another one

Don't share this key with anyone else.
